# 📖 Day 1: A Simple Guide to Ethereum

Today I learned about the purpose and design of Ethereum, and how it differs from Bitcoin.

- **Beyond digital currency:** Ethereum isn’t just for payments , it’s a decentralized, programmable blockchain, often called “the world computer.”
- **Smart contracts & dApps:** Ethereum enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with:
  - Frontend: regular web tech (React, HTML, etc.)
  - Backend: smart contracts on the blockchain (usually written in Solidity)
- **dApps benefits:** decentralized, transparent, and trustless.

### 🔗 Similarities between Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Both use blockchain and cryptographic currency (BTC vs ETH)
- Both rely on peer-to-peer networks and consensus to confirm transactions

### ⚡ Differences
- Ethereum is programmable and Turing complete; Bitcoin’s scripting language is limited
- Bitcoin focuses on payments and security; Ethereum focuses on flexibility, running complex apps, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc.

### 🧠 Key concept: Turing completeness
- Ethereum’s EVM can run any computation, which makes it possible to build complex smart contracts.
- Bitcoin keeps its scripting simple to reduce risk.

### 📜 History
- Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 after MasterCoin rejected the idea
- First block mined on July 30, 2015
- Co-founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, who helped make it Turing complete
