# 📚 Ethereum Learning Journal

Welcome! 👋

This repository is my **personal learning journal**, where I document everything I learn about **Ethereum**, blockchain concepts, smart contracts, and related topics.

Every day, I write and commit notes, explanations, code snippets, or mini-articles covering what I studied — from how wallets sign transactions, to how the EVM works, to the details of consensus mechanisms.
