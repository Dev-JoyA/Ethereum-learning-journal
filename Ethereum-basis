# 📖 Day 6: Ethereum Unveiled – A Deep Dive into the World’s Programmable Blockchain

Today, I wrapped together everything I've been learning about Ethereum: from wallets and cryptography to Proof of Stake, validators, attacks & defenses, and running my own node.

## 🧠 What I explored:
- Why Ethereum is more than just digital currency
- How the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** makes it programmable
- Wallets: EOAs vs. contract accounts, seed phrases & private keys
- Cryptography: asymmetric keys, ECDSA, Keccak-256 hashing
- Proof of Stake: how blocks are proposed & finalized every 12 seconds
- Security: slashing, Sybil attack defenses, staking as economic protection
- Running my own node locally (Sepolia testnet) to see transactions directly

---

## ⚙️ Summary of key points:
- Ethereum nodes keep the blockchain in sync through the **P2P network**
- Validators propose & attest to blocks, earning rewards or risking slashing
- The EVM runs smart contracts as bytecode
- Cryptography keeps data secure & trustless: private keys never shared, signatures prove authenticity
- Staking protects the network by making attacks expensive and risky
